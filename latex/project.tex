\section{Introduction}

Language modeling and text generation are important aspects of the greater
field of natural language processing. In this paper, we use a naive language
model based on Markovian assumptions to generate novel sentences from a text
corpus. A major pain point for engineers and entrepreneurs lies in trying to
determine what project or idea to work on. The specific application of text
generation we examine in this paper seeks to alleviate this problem: our model creates fake, believable startup ideas using a dataset of company descriptions from the startup database Crunchbase.

Our generative model is primarily based on Markov chains, which are decision
processes that are characterized by the Markov property. A decision process is said to have the Markov property when any given state is independent of the preceding and following states. We can express this more formally:

\[ P(X_n = x|X_0,\dots,X_{n-1}) = P(X_n = x|X_{n-1})\,\,\forall{n}\forall{x}\]

Though the traditional form of the Markov chain was first produced by mathematician Andrey Markov, the research our implementation follows is
provided by Alexander Volfovsky, 2007. \cite{volfovsky2007long} When generating sentences, the biggest difficulties we had were ensuring syntactical correctness and ensuring a desired level of creativity (i.e., not creating sentences that in large part already appear in the training corpus). We were able to dramatically improve syntax by accounting for parts of speech during training and sentence generation.

\section{Background}


\section{Related Work}

For instance, \cite{hochreiter1997long}


\section{Body 1}

A clear specification of the algorithm(s) you used and a description
of the main data structures in the implementation. Include a
discussion of any details of the algorithm that were not in the
published paper(s) that formed the basis of your implementation. A
reader should be able to reconstruct and verify your work from reading
your paper.

\section{Body 2}


\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{MyAlgorithm}{$b$}
    \State{$a \gets 10$}
    \EndProcedure{}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \caption{Here is the algorithm.}
\end{algorithm}



\section{Experiments}
Analysis, evaluation, and critique of the algorithm and your
implementation. Include a description of the testing data you used and
a discussion of examples that illustrate major features of your
system. Testing is a critical part of system construction, and the
scope of your testing will be an important component in our
evaluation. Discuss what you learned from the implementation.

\appendix

\section{Program Trace}

Appendix 1 – A trace of the program showing how it handles key examples or some other demonstration of the program in action.

\section{System Description}

 Appendix 2 – A clear description of how to use your system and how to generate the output you discussed in the write-up and the example transcript in Appendix 1. N.B.: The teaching staff must be able to run your system.

\section{Group Makeup}

 Appendix 3 – A list of each project participant and that
participant’s contributions to the project. If the division of work
varies significantly from the project proposal, provide a brief
explanation.  Your code should be clearly documented.
